They said release 'Remote Control'<br>
But we didn't want it on the label<br>
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"<br>
The people laughed but the press went mad<br>
<p>
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart<br>
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh<br>

On the last tour my mates couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
At every hotel we was met by the Law
Come for the party - come to make sure!

Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song

They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee
An' worry about it later

Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand
Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand!

All over the news spread fast
They're dirty, they're filthy
They ain't gonna last!

This is Joe Public speaking
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind

Total
See-o-n control - that means you!
